        I focus on getting every aspect of design correct when implementing mockups into code and not just
        code for the sake of coding or treat it as a chore but really take passion into what I am doing and have every 
        part of a design perfect to the smallest pixel.

        For me beautiful user interface and experience is not just a display of fancy designs but to build trust for the user and
        the website, while providing them a soothing experience that will leave them an impression that they found
        the service they have been looking for and can trust.

        Whether it is a small brand to a simple personal project app, I always look at the bigger picture and think
        what if we add this new feature or how will this app look in the next few months and 3 years? By implementing
        software best practices and design patterns, this allows any app for businesses to grow and save time and money
        without worrying what will happen to their app or why things go wrong.

        As a self taught developer, I am constantly learning new UI/UX trends, and technologies to widen my range of skills
        and provide valuable help for growing businesses. I am eager to showcase my skills and to use them in a career that I enjoy.
        Over the years, I learned how to learn when it comes to new technologies and how to approach and debug problems  even when
        there may be no solution or is a first-timer. Working with other developers also helped me to grow and understand how 
        senior developers approach problems.
